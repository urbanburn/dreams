  welcome_guest_title: Welcome to our Spectacles
  welcome_guest_text_html: Congratulations! You've stumbled upon something special! <a href='http://urbanburn.se'>Urban Burn Stockholm: The Eclectical Spectacle</a> is a festival in Stockholm where all content is created by the participants. It is a part of a network of regional events connected to the Burning Man festival in Black Rock, Nevada. It is a blank canvas, on which we are all invited to come paint. We will fill up 2000 sqm at Nobelberget, creating art, music, dance, performance and play - all shaped and initiated by the community (that means you). Building happens whenever you have time on April 12th and 13th, on the 14th, 15th, and 16th we play and party, and on the 16th and 17th we clean up and leave the place as we found it.
This site is where we dream up our spectacles for The Eclectical Spectacle. A spectacle is human expression, shared. This expression can be anything you like. The form, whatever you will! You can weld, build, paint or even create robotic underwater 3-D architecture. Maybe you know how to tell a great story. Or give a wonderful massage. Or make an awesome sandwich! Perhaps you give amazing hugs? Your spectacle is you, bringing what you want to give. What will you do at the Spectacle? Go ahead, create!
